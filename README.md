# PythonClock
A work in progress: currently a basic clock using Python tkinter and math libraries to build a clock display. A nice, easy demonstration of basic trigonometry using the math library and  tkinter library for the display window. My current  plan (when I work up the motivation and time to do it, lol) is to API the program to WorldTimeAPI.
